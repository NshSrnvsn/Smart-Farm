# Smart-Farm

## What
An automation solution for irrigation synchronization and regularization of water consumption 

## Why
Farming accounts for 70% of the water consumed and most of its wasteful use in the world.
 
## The solution
Smart Farm- Using Soil Moisture sensor we automate the irrigation process.
Set a threshold moisture Level (say 300), if the sensor detects level less than the threshold(<300) it pumps water into the fields else it doesnt irrigte the land.

This way not just the water wastage is under check but also the crop sowers do not have to keep check of the water levels and frequent irrigation.

## Requirements
1. Arduino Uno
2. 12v DC motor
3. Moisture Sensor
4. Relay
5. Adapter

Proposed Method using one Sensor was used as proof of concept and inorder to implement at large scale, grid sort of connection of the sensors with pipes at square area of land is suggested.
